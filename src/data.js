The reason I wanted one is to showcase all the projects I have been working on for the past few years. \nThis project was built on React.js using create-react-app. Some extra add-ons that I also ended up using were styled-component and react-router. Styled components allowed me to quickly add css without making global changes, and react-router allowed for quick and easy re-routing.",

I noticed that whenever I work on multiple projects, I forget what methods I needed to work on, what tests were done and what functunality I needed to research. Hence, I created a very specific TODO web page which allows for creating TODO lists based on different projects. Furthermore, I wanted to set due dates which would be the indexes for priority queue. \nThe reason I went with Flask was because of its versatility and quickness. Setting up an app using Flask was an extremely quick task. Moreover, the documentation was easily accessible and the community seemed to have made a lot of examples which I incorporated in my own app.",

REST API was implemented through TypeScript. Majority of the project was done using TypeScript and JavaScript. Testing was implemented using Mocha Test Environment with Chai Expectations. \n Some extra libraries that were used in this project include jszip and parse5. jszip helped with quick access to zip files which were later processed through our back-end. parse5 was used for web scraping all of the information about buildings."
